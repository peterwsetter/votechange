The results from the United States 2018 election allowed both political parties to claim victory. Even with the results in Florida and Arizona up in the air, the Republicians are set to pick up seats in the Senate, while the Demoracts have secured a majority in the House. Was this election a split-chamber decision?

Micah Cohen of FiveThirtyEight, amongst others, has suggested that the House popular vote should be used as the sentiment of the country. Since voter registration and turnout varies so greatly, I'm not sure this is the right metric, but even if it is, the Electral College overrides the popular vote. For those interested in the strategy of the 2020 election, it's important to determine where and why the vote changed. Was it a change in sentiment in the country or a Trumpless ticket? 

Nate Silver started to address this question in an article on [November 8](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-map-looked-a-lot-like-2012-and-that-got-me-thinking-about-2020/) by using the 2018 House vote for the 2020 Electral College. I wanted to take the next step and analyze changes in vote totals in several key swing states.

For each congressional district, how did the total votes for each party change? Were the relative changes in Democratic and Republician votes similar or were they different? For those districts where the shift wasn't proprotional, could we attribute it to Trump? Does the difference in vote proportion between Trump and the 2016 candidate correlate with the 2018 difference? Does Trump score?

Election results where obtained from [MIT Elections Science and Data Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/). The 2016 results are in their [`elections` R package](https://github.com/MEDSL/elections)[^1], and 2018 from their [2018-elections Github repo](https://github.com/MEDSL/2018-elections). The 2018 results are in raw format, scrapped from elections website, and needed to be processed before analysis. This is documented in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/peterwsetter/votechange/blob/master/process-2018.R) for this project. The [Trump Scores](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/house/) were [scrapped](https://github.com/peterwsetter/votechange/blob/master/get-data.R) from FiveThirtyEight.

This analysis will start with Indiana, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. As results are available, I will expand the analysis to Arizonia, Iowa, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin.

## Compare the Total Votes for Each Party

The 2016 House results from `election` are listed by predincts. This data was aggregated for candidate totals in the district. One flaw in this dataset is that Minnesota's Democractic-Farm-Labor party isn't labeled as "democratic". Before summarizing, party labels will be adjusted to include the DFL. 

```{r house_district_2018}
house_precincts_2016 %>% 
  filter(year == 2016,
         office == 'US House') %>% 
  # Standardize party labels
  mutate(party = case_when(party %~% '^[D,d]' ~ 'D',
                           party %~% '^[R,r]' ~ 'R',
                           TRUE ~ 'O'),
         candidate = candidate_normalized
         ) %>% 
  group_by(year, state, district, candidate, party) %>% 
  summarize(candidate_votes = sum(votes)) ->
  house_district_2016


```

After a union of the 2016 and 2018 results, the votes are aggregated at the state level. To compare the number of votes cast, I calculated the proportion of votes cast for each party in 2018 compared to 2016.

```{r house_votechange}
state_abbrevs <- data_frame(
  state = state.name,
  state_abbrev = state.abb
)

house_district_2016 %>% 
  # Just include states 
  filter(state %in% CURRENT_STATES) %>% 
  bind_rows(house_district_2018) %>% 
  inner_join(state_abbrevs,
             by = c('state' = 'state')) %>% 
  mutate(state_district = paste0(state_abbrev,'-', district)) ->
  house_district

house_district %>% 
  group_by(state, party, year) %>% 
  summarize(party_votes = sum(candidate_votes)) %>% 
  group_by(state, party) %>% 
  filter(n() == 2) %>% 
  arrange(year, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  summarize(votechange_prop = round(last(party_votes)/first(party_votes), 2)) %>% 
  filter(party != 'O') %>% 
  mutate(label_text = paste0(round(votechange_prop*100), '%')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(state, votechange_prop, 
             fill = party)) +
  votechange_chart +
  labs(title = 'Change in Votes Cast for House Candidates:\n2018 Relative to 2016',
       y = 'Percent Change',
       x = NULL)
```

Compared to 2016, there was approximately 20% fewer votes cast in Indiana for candidates of either major party. This is in sharp contrast to Minnesota and Pennsylvania, where Democratic candidates received approximately the **same** number of total votes while there was a sharp decline in votes cast for Republican candidates. 

```{r}
house_district %>% 
  group_by(state, state_district, party, year) %>% 
  summarize(party_votes = sum(candidate_votes)) %>% 
  group_by(state, state_district, party) %>% 
  filter(n() == 2) %>% 
  arrange(year, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  summarize(votechange_prop = round(last(party_votes)/first(party_votes), 2)) ->
  district_votechange

district_votechange %>% 
  filter(party != 'O',
         state != 'Pennsylvania') %>% 
  mutate(label_text = paste0(round(votechange_prop*100), '%')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(state_district, votechange_prop, 
             fill = party)) +
  votechange_chart +
  facet_wrap(~state, ncol = 1, scales = 'free_y') +
  labs(title = 'Change in Votes Cast for House Candidates:\n2018 Relative to 2016',
       y = 'Percent Change',
       x = NULL) 
```

Summarizing by state:

```{r votechange_trumpscore}
district_votechange %>% 
  filter(party != 'O',
         state != 'Pennsylvania') %>% 
  group_by(state_district) %>% 
  filter(n() == 2) %>% 
  inner_join(trump_scores_house,
             by = c('state_district' = 'district')) ->
  vc_ts
```

```{r vc_ts_graphs}
vc_ts %>% 
  group_by(state_district, trump_plus_minus) %>% 
  summarize(upper = max(votechange_prop),
            lower = min(votechange_prop)) %>% 
  mutate(party = 'R') %>% 
  select(-trump_plus_minus) ->
  diff_line

vc_ts %>% 
  left_join(diff_line,
            by = c('state_district' = 'state_district',
                  'party' = 'party'))  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(trump_plus_minus, votechange_prop, color = party,
             text = state_district), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('#0015BC', '#FF0000'),
                    name = 'Party') +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), color = 'gray') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(lab = 'Change in House Votes Cast vs 538 Trump +/-',
       x = 'Trump +/-',
       y = 'Change in House Votes Cast') ->
    votechange_trumpscore_graph
  
plotly::ggplotly(votechange_trumpscore_graph, 
                 tooltip = c('text', 'trump_plus_minus', 'votechange_prop'))
  
```


[^1:] I had difficulty installing `elections` on my AWS Ubuntu server. The repo itself contains the data as `.rds` files, so `git clone`ing locally was a quick workaround.
